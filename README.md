# Multiview-3D-VAE-GAN
Final Project for my graduate course CMPSCI674 - Intelligent Visual Computing at UMass

The baseline code was taken from https://github.com/rimchang/3DGAN-Pytorch

Multiview extension of the 3D-VAE-GAN architecture introduced in the paper "Learning a Probabilistic Latent Space of Object Shapes via 3D Generative-Adversarial Modeling"
